wget the wireshark file

then opened it and checked "Statistics > Capture_File_Properties" just to get an idea of what are we dealing with as well as "Protocol Hierarchy" which is also below Statistics

typed: "udp.stream == 0" in the filter bar. Got a package!

File > Export_Objects > TFTP

Saved everything

Got text 2 files, 3 pictures and a deb file for steghide

Used: https://cyberchef.org/ to check crypted text files 

Seems like Rot13 gives some tips. The word "DUEDILIGENCE" 

Finally tried to extract 3 of the pictures with steghide

>> steghide extract -sf picture3.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE

wrote extracted data to "flag.txt"
